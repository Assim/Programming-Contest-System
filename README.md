Programming Contest System
==============================
Programming Contest System is a Java system that I created as my final year college project. This project demostrates the use of Multi-threading, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Serialization, Java Database Connectivity, and more.

The main goal of this project is to allow a Contest Admin (Server) to configure the contest and Contestants (Client) to submit solutions to programs and it will validate them and update the scoreboard automatically. There are tons of features that can be included, and you might encounter some bugs, and that's because it's a project and not a live system.

Please refer to the Report.docx file for more information about the project.
